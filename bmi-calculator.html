        <!--aghhhh fuck i forgot how to put text in the radio options. i'll just change it into checkbox or something
        okay WOW i forgot what's the difference between checkbox and radio. lemme just run a test or something.
        okay so apparently, it's best if i use radio. fuck it, let's use that!
        it's probably not a good idea to put everything in a <p> tag. let me try something...
        nah, it looks better if i put everything in the <p> tag. this'll probably come back to bite me in the ass later on after i'm done structuring the website, i doubt it though.
        why am i creating div classes again? i have no clue!-->

                <!--dude holy shit all hail google's inspect element because i would've never remembered that the label element pairs with the id attribute
                damn i'm really overcomplicating this
                in my most humble defense, i'm just thinking ahead because i know this'll come to bite me in the ass later with css. let's not even get started on javascript ohhhhhhhhhhh thank biology that i'm still young and hyper self aware-->
